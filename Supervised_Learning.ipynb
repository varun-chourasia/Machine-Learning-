        "\n",
        "Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that models the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to predict continuous numerical values. It works by finding a straight line that best fits the data points on a scatter plot, with the goal of minimizing the distance between the line and the points. This algorithm is used for tasks like predicting housing prices based on size or forecasting sales revenue from historical data.  \n",

        "`Relationship modeling:` Linear regression establishes a mathematical relationship between variables to understand how they influence each other.\n",
